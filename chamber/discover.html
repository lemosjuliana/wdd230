                <p>In the 18th century, the owners of Sant'Anna dos Olhos D'√Ågua's Farm, 
                    Domingos Barbosa de Ara√∫jo and Ana Brandoa, built a chapel dedicated 
                    to Saint Anne. The location became a reference for those who traveled 
                    to the region.
                    At the end of the century, the development of trade, particularly in livestock, 
                    created a small ville, known today as the city of Feira de Santana (Saint Anne's Fair).

                    </div> 
                    <p>The growing pace of development of the village required the construction 
                        of wider roads, and the commercial houses began to be installed to serve 
                        the growing population. Today the population is over 600,000 inhabitants (2020 Census).
                        The construction of the city hall began in 1921, by Colonel Bernardino da Silva Bahia, 
                        and it was completed in 1926, by Colonel Arnold Silva. The building holds the Mayor's Office,
                        the Agriculture Department, the Environment  and Natural Resources Department, the 
                        Social Government Department and the Main Hall.

                    <p>Feira de Santana is one of the most important economic centers in the state. 
                        The city's economy supports itself through the service sector and the trade sectors. 
                        Together, they are responsible for 63% of the city's production. Over time, other 
                        segments stood out, such as industrial activities. There is no way of measuring the importance of the city's economy for the region, the state,  and for the whole of country. Because of that, Feira is expanding.

                    <p>The monuments tell us a lot about the history, the people, the culture and 
                        other  aspects of the city.  Each one carries with it a meaning: the monument 
                        above honors Maria Quit√©ria de Jesus Medeiros, heroine of the Independence War 
                        and the first woman to fight in Brazil. Located at the intersection of two important 
                        avenues, it was designed by architect Luiz Humberto de Carvalho.

                    <p>The city is known for its lakes and lagoons. Recently, the local 
                        government promoted a campaign to clean and preserve the (Lagoa Azul) Blue Lagoon.
                        In the 60s, the city had more than sixty lakes.
